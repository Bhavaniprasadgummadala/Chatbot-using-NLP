# Chatbot-using-NLP
This project builds a chatbot using NLP to understand and respond to user inputs. It involves collecting data (patterns and intents), preprocessing text (removing stop words, punctuation), and using machine learning for intent recognition, enabling the chatbot to provide relevant responses in conversations.
